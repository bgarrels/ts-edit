# Introduction #
To use ts-edit,you need to unpack the newest archive.
Normally you should find a file called "project1"
If you unpack the executable,it should have the Executable-Icon and you can run it.
# Details #
It is very important to unpack this file!
Else Ubuntu's Archive Manager(others not tested) will think the File is a type text.

# Requirements #
  * GTK1(I know,it is old)
  * rights to read/write files on the Disk.
